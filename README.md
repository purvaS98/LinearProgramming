The Binary ILP file contains the graphical representation of a simple binary integer linear type problem.
Binary ILP constraints: x + y <= 1, x, y are binary variables

The Mixed ILP file contains the graphical representation of a simple mixed integer linear type problem.
Mixed ILP constraints: 2x + y <= 10, 0 <= x <= 5, y is integer

The Pure ILP file contains the graphical representation of a simple integer linear type problem.
Pure ILP constraints: 2x + 3y <= 10, x, y are integers
